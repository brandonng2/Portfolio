                    Hi! I am a 4th year Data Science major at the UC, San Diego. 
                    Inspired by Baymax from "Big Hero 6," 
                    I've been passionate about machine learning, artificial 
                    intelligence, and computer vision. The idea of using 
                    technology to make an impact on people's lives 
                    drew me to this field, and I've been passionate about 
                    exploring the possibilities of computer science ever since.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Beyond academics, I enjoy weight lifting, playing 
                    basketball and badminton, hanging out with friends and eating delicious food. I'm always eager to learn about new technologies and collaborate on projects that make a difference!
